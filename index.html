        <h2>Henry VIII</h2>
        <p>Henry VIII is most famous for his 6 wives. When he decided to get a second one, he couldn't, as England was Catholic at the time, so he couldn't divorce. He looked towards the Pope. Unfortunately, the pope said no, so he built his own church of England and named himself in-charge.</p>
        <p>He only became king when he was <i>10 years old</i>. He died of gout (wich comes from eating rich food) and from portraits, we could tell he was a bit broad! When he died, his 6th wife was still alive, Catherine Parr. Through her father, she was a descendant of John of Gaunt, son of king Edward III.</p>
        <p>Henry VIII was the son of Henry VII (commonly known as Henry Tudor) was probably the most famous Tudor king. At first, people thought he was nice, but soon became scared. By the end of his reign, people were terrified of him. Suprisingly, Henry only spent 1 hour of being king a day! He excpected the Pope to do it for him.</p>
        <p>If you follow the family, Henry's 1st wife, Catherine of Aragon was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, whose son would connect England and Scotland as one Community. So, Henry VIII would be the 13th-great-uncle of Prince Philip, but because the two are married, Queen Elizabeth has a similar relationship to Henry.</p>
        <p>Jane Seymour was Henry VIII's favourite wife, but this queen wouldn't win being the most popular. Anne Boleyn would probably win now. Actually, Jane Seymour was the only one who Henry VIII didn't get rid of, she died of childbirth. Also, she was mother of Edward VI.</p>
        <p>He killed <i>2</i> of his wives. Anne Boleyn, and Cathrine Howard. To kill Anne Boleyn, he hired a French sword man, instead of an axe man!</p>

        <h2>Henry Tudor</h2>
        <p>To get in charge of England, Henry Tudor had to win a war. A war between two tribes, the
        red rose and the white rose. But, to end this war, all Henry had to do was was marry Elizabeth of york, as Henry was on the red rose and Elizabeth was on the white rose and when they married, the two roses formed into the Tudor Rose. The battle originated from the Battle of Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. King Richard III died at battle in 1485 and King Henry VII was crowned king of England.</p>
        <p>He had 4 children. Margaret Tudor, Mary Tudor, and Arther, prince of wales. When Henry and Elizabeth made their last baby, Elizabeth died of child birth. She was only 37 when she died!</p>
        <p>The Tudors were a Welsh family that had the throne from 1485-1603. The Tudor dynasty ended when Henry VII grand-daughter died childless, as the boy she had a crush on had a wife, and his wife never died until the man died. Henry died of Tubercolosis, wich infects the lungs, but can also harm other parts of the body.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth married Henry in 1486, only a year after the Tudor reign started! Ther first son was Arther, prince of wales, their second son was Henry VIII (see above) their first daughter was Mary Tudor, and their second was Margeret Tudor.</p>
        <p>When Tudors took the throne, England was a Roman Catholic country, the church was run by the Roman pope, Clement VII, and England was catholic for all of Henry VII reign, and much of Henry the VIII's.</p>
        <p>Henry VII was the first monarch of th house of Tudor. He gained power by his army defeating him at the battle of bosworth field. Henry was succesful restoring power of the English Monarch during the civil war.</p>

        <p>On the 8 of Febuary, Mary Tudor was killed by Elizabeth, for treason. Her son, King James VI of scotland calmly acsepted his mothers exacution, and when Elizabeth died, he ruled Ireland, England and Scotland.</p>
